        <p>The Indian national calendar, sometimes called the Shalivahana Shaka calendar. It is used, alongside the Gregorian calendar, by The Gazette of India, in news broadcasts by All India Radio and in calendars and communications issued by the Government of India. The Saka calendar is also used in Java and Bali among Indonesian Hindus. Nyepi, the \"Day of Silence\", is a celebration of the Saka new year in Bali. Nepal's Nepal Sambat evolved from the Saka calendar. Prior to colonization, the Philippines used to apply the Saka calendar as well as suggested by the Laguna Copperplate Inscription.</p>
        <p>The term may also ambiguously refer to the Hindu calendar; the Shalivahana era is also commonly used by other calendars.</p>
        <p>The historic Shalivahana era calendar is still widely used. It has years that are solar.</p>
